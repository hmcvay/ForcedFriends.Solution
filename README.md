## Description

We all want some good company when watching our favorite movies. That's where ReelFriends comes in. With ReelFriends, you simply add movies you want to watch to your watchlist, and ReelFriends matches you with other users who also want to watch one of your movies! ReelFriends compares your watchlist to the other user's watchlist and displays matches based on match count. Now you have a Reel Friend! Make real friends with Reel Friends.
